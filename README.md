[中文点这](https://github.com/Misaka15535/flower/README_zh_cn.md)

My English is not good, the content here is mainly translated by Google.
Although this will also be updated (I will use Google Translate to ensure a certain degree of perfection), the synchronization progress may be slightly slower.
If you can read Chinese, please read the Chinese documentation first.
Iterative updates will be mainly based on Chinese documents.

If you would like to help with translation, you are very welcome.

Good luck.
